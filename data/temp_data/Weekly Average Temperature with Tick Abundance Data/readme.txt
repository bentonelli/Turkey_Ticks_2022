This folder contains weekly temperature data of the weeks for which NEON also provides ticks abundance data. 

Temperature data include weekly minimum, maximum and mean. Missing data were found online at https://www.wunderground.com/ using the siteâ€™s latitude and longitude and were then entered manually into the csv files. I ensured that the website provided accurate temperature information by comparing available temperature data downloaded from NEON with the data on the website.

I have also merged the nine site-specific tables into one large file which allows me to visualize and analyze a global trend between temperature and ticks abundance.
